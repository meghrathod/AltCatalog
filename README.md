**DESCRIPTION**

uYouPlus is packed with the tweaks iSponsorBlock, YTUHD, uYou, YTClassicVideoQuality, YTDisableUglySuggestions, YouAreThere, and YouPiP straight out the box for an enhanced display of features from all of the most revered developers behind all of your favorite tweaks.

**FEATURES**

uYou: uYou has a ton of features that I can't list them all. Visit here for more info!

iSponsorBlock: Skips annoying sponsor ads inside videos. iSponsorBlock is based on SponsorBlock engine. Basically, this is the iOS version of the SponsorBlock extension.

YouPiP: enable YouTube's native PiP. More options are in YouTube Settings - General.

YTUHD: unlock VP9 codec and in effect, enables video quality of 2K and 4K. You can enable/disable YTUHD in YouTube Settings - Video quality preferences.

And more...!
YTClassicVideoQuality: since YouTube v16.xx, you need one more step to change the video quality. YTClassicVideoQuality brings back the old video quality selector, which is a lot better than the new one.

YTNoHoverCards: offer an option to enable/disable the annoying suggested videos show up at the end of the videos.

YTSystemAppearance: sync the YouTube theme (dark/light) with the system theme.

YTNoCheckLocalNetwork: block the Local Network permission popup.

YouRememberCaption: make YouTube remember your video caption setting (if not already).
